					<p> I am from a small town (~2000 people) in Northern California called Kenwood. I grew up there for the first 15 years of my life. I moved to the bigger town 15 minutes away, where I attended high school at Maria Carrillo.</p>
					<p>After graduating, I attended San Diego State University for a year, then transferred to Cal State Chico for another 4 years. After leaving Chico State with a degree in Business Management, options in Small Business Management and also Project Management. </p>
					<p>I took all my belongings and moved to the middle Oregon. While there I worked at a bar during the night, but was able to golf during the day. After six months, I moved down to Southern California and started my first real job, post-college.</p>
					<p>I left that job after about 5 years and started to go back to school. Now I am here, at UCLA Extension, taking a coding bootcamp and having fun.</p>
